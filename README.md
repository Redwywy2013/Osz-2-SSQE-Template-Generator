# Osz-2-SSQE-Template-Generator
Simply takes a .osz file (Osu! Song Archive File) and turns it into a .txt and .ini for use in SSQE (Sound Space Quantum Editor).  This will not generate a map for you, only a map template, with BPM automatically configurated.



All you have to do is find a song here, https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets
Download it, open the app, and drag the .osz file onto the window, and a folder will appear in your downloads folder

Now, just open the .txt with SSQE, and you'll have a ready-to-map template, with audio and BPM already in place!



If you have issues or would like to request a feature, please DM me on Discord, @redduy35, instead of making an Issue message! I see Discord messages almost instantly, as oppose to the Issues tab, and I just have an easier time communicating through Discord anyways.. :3
